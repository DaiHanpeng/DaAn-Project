//this repository is for DaAn - SIEMENS instrument connection project.

//in this project, we divide it in 2 parts, Server side(DaAn) and Client side(SIEMENS).

//and this repository is just for client side.


//As for client side, we can still divide it into 2 parts,

//first, we capture data from GUI, and then put them into DB.

//secondary, we fetch data from DB and then send them via function defined in DLL(C#).


//Part1 is written in sikulix and JPython

//Part2 is written in IronPython.


//let's get start...
